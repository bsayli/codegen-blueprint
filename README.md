> **Codegen Blueprint** is for teams who care less about *how fast a project starts*  
> and more about *how well its architecture survives over time*.

---

### 🤔 Should I clone this repository?

Clone this project if you’ve ever seen a codebase start clean and slowly drift into chaos —
where architectural rules exist only in slides, not in code.

**Codegen Blueprint is not a faster way to scaffold a project.**
It is a deliberate way to turn architectural intent into **executable, testable guardrails**
that provide **fast, build-time feedback** from day zero.

It doesn’t just generate a project —
it generates a project whose architectural boundaries remain **continuously verifiable on every build**.

If long-term maintainability, domain purity, and **early visibility when boundary drift begins** matter to you,
this repository is worth your time.

---

### 🛡 1.0.0 Non-Negotiable Promise

**Every project generated by Codegen Blueprint 1.0.0 can include executable architectural guardrails — when enabled.**
Not documentation, not conventions — but **generated, executable rules** that make architectural drift visible immediately.

These guardrails provide **early, unambiguous build-time feedback**,
turning architectural intent into a **living contract** rather than a set of guidelines.

When boundaries are crossed, the build does not silently succeed —
it **signals the drift clearly**, while context is still fresh and easy to correct.

This is not about punishment or restriction.  
It is about **protecting architectural intent as the system evolves**.

## Release & Compatibility Discipline

Codegen Blueprint follows an explicit **release discipline** where versions represent
**architectural and compatibility contracts**, not feature counts.
Starting from **1.0.0 GA**, guarantees around generation determinism, structure,
and executable architecture guardrails are intentional and protected.

Breaking changes are introduced **only in major versions** and are never silent.
For details, see:  
👉 [Release Discipline](docs/policies/release-discipline.md)

### What We Explicitly Do NOT Guarantee

Codegen Blueprint is intentionally **constrained by design**.
Some things are not supported — not by accident, but to protect architectural integrity.

Before adopting the project, please review what is **explicitly out of scope**:  
👉 [What We Do NOT Guarantee](docs/policies/what-we-do-not-guarantee.md)

### 🧾 Project History (Short)

Codegen Blueprint started as an early experiment in Spring Boot project bootstrapping (`codegen-springboot-initializr`).
As the project evolved, the focus shifted from “scaffolding” to **Executable Architecture** — guardrails that can fail the build.
The current `main` branch reflects this pivot and the architecture-first direction.
Earlier `0.x` tags are kept for historical context and experimentation, but they do **not** define the GA guarantees.
**The compatibility and guarantee contract begins with 1.0.0 GA.**

## 🧭 Architecture as a Product

Most teams don’t fail because they chose the wrong framework.  
They fail because **architecture slowly drifts once the project is “up and running.”**

What starts as a clean design turns into:
- shortcuts under delivery pressure
- blurred boundaries between layers
- domain logic leaking into frameworks
- “we’ll fix it later” decisions that never get fixed

Traditional project generators help you **start fast** —  
but they disappear the moment the first commit is made.

**Codegen Blueprint exists to address what happens *after* generation.**

It treats architecture as a **first-class, executable product** that:

* **Makes architectural boundaries visible** — layered and/or Hexagonal (opt-in)
* **Surfaces architectural drift early**, before it becomes structural damage
* **Keeps the domain insulated from frameworks by construction**
* **Aligns early decisions across teams** — automatically and consistently

> **Executable Architecture — Delivered from day zero. Sustained over time.**

### 🧩 Generate vs Deliver Capabilities (Cross-Cutting Concerns)

Most generators **generate code** for cross-cutting concerns.  
That approach does not scale.

**Codegen Blueprint makes a deliberate distinction:**

| Approach                 | What happens                                                     | Long-term effect                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Generate code            | Copies security, logging, error handling into each service       | ❌ Drift, copy-paste, painful upgrades        |
| Deliver as capabilities  | Centralized, versioned, opt-in behavior via shared libraries     | **✔ Consistency, easier upgrades, alignment** |

> **Not everything should be generated.**  
> Cross-cutting concerns should be **delivered as capabilities**, not duplicated as code.

With Blueprint Platform:

* Architecture is generated once
* Runtime behavior is **standardized via shared libraries / BOMs**
* Capabilities are **centrally versioned and opt-in**
* Upgrades happen in **one place**, not across 50 microservices

This is why Blueprint is not a template collection.

> **It is architecture as an executable product —  
> where behavior is shared, aligned, and evolves safely over time.**

---

> 🧩 Same simplicity — **stronger long-term alignment**

## ⚡ What is Codegen Blueprint (Today)?

A **CLI-driven**, **profile-based**, **architecture-aware** project generator
that turns architectural decisions into **executable output**.

📌 Current profile: **spring-boot-maven-java**

> Spring Boot 3.5+ · Java 21 · Maven — production-ready baseline

Codegen Blueprint today delivers:

* Deterministic, production-ready project scaffolding
* Clean source layout (main and test) with verified bootstrapping
* **Framework-free domain core by construction**
* Profile-driven architecture selection (standard / hexagonal)
* Optional architecture guardrails via generated ArchUnit tests  
  *(enabled with `--guardrails basic | strict`)*
* Maven configuration, wrapper, and build baseline
* Application configuration (`application.yml`)
* Optional **basic sample code** for both:
  * **standard (layered)** layout
  * **hexagonal (ports & adapters)** layout

> Architecture is not only generated —  
> it can be **evaluated and verified at build time as part of the project output**.

---

### 🧪 Executable Architecture — Proof

Codegen Blueprint does not rely on conventions, guidelines, or documentation
to protect architectural intent.

When **strict guardrails** is enabled, architectural boundaries are translated into
**generated, executable rules** that are evaluated during the build.

Violations surface immediately and **fail the build deterministically** —  
not as a punishment, but as **fast, unambiguous feedback while context is still fresh**,
when fixes are cheapest and intent is clearest.

👉 **See the full, reproducible executable architecture proof:**  
[Executable Architecture Proof](docs/demo/executable-architecture-proof.md)

---
## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Architecture isn’t only drawn — it **executes** here.

Hexagonal Architecture is not a stylistic preference in Codegen Blueprint.  
It is a **structural foundation** that keeps architectural intent intact as systems evolve.

> Generate once.  
> Evolve across frameworks, runtimes, and languages — **without rewriting the core**.

Spring Boot is the first delivery adapter — not the foundation.

### 🧩 Part of the Blueprint Platform

`codegen-blueprint` is the first foundational module of the **Blueprint Platform** — an architecture-first project generation ecosystem designed to enable consistent, observable, and scalable enterprise development.

Unlike traditional generators that simply scaffold code, Blueprint Platform focuses on **making architectural intent explicit and testable**, from the moment a project is generated.

It aims to:

* **Standardize enterprise best practices** through opinionated architecture and code structure
* **Integrate reusable common libraries** that encapsulate cross-cutting concerns (security, logging, error handling, tracing, OpenAPI clients, etc.)
* **Make architectural boundaries visible and verifiable** through generated structure and optional guardrails  
  (e.g. hexagonal boundaries, naming consistency, test-ready layouts)

As the platform evolves, additional modules will complement `codegen-blueprint` with:

* Ready-to-use, behavior-driven shared libraries
* Consistent and generics-aware OpenAPI client generation
* Support for multiple frameworks and technology stacks

🔗 Learn more at the [Blueprint Platform GitHub organization](https://github.com/blueprint-platform)

> This aligns with the upcoming **Vision & Roadmap** section below.

> **The domain stays clean — ports define intent, adapters handle the outside world.**

```
domain       // business logic only
application  // orchestrates ports
adapter     // inbound/outbound driven by use cases
bootstrap   // Spring wiring + config
```

### Guarantees

* **No Spring annotations inside the domain**
* **Hexagonal from day zero — when opted‑in**
* Flexible to evolve with future profiles (CQRS, Layered…)

## 🔌 Inbound & Outbound Adapters

Adapters drive interactions **in** and **out** of the core domain — keeping domain logic isolated, explicit, and testable.

### Inbound (Delivery) — How requests enter

| Adapter | Status     | Description                                          |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI    | ✔ GA Ready | Primary driver to generate services via command-line |
| REST   | 🚧 Planned | Future interactive generation + onboarding UX        |

### Outbound (Artifacts) — What the engine produces

> Architectural **guardrail artifacts** are generated as part of the output — not hard-wired into the engine.

Everything required to **build → run → extend** a real service:

* Maven POM + Wrapper
* Main & Test source structure
* Domain + Application + Adapter layout
* Application configuration (YAML)
* Optional **basic sample code**, depending on selected layout:
  * **standard (layered)** sample slice
  * **hexagonal (ports & adapters)** sample slice
* Optional **architecture checks (ArchUnit tests)**  
  *(enabled via `--guardrails basic|strict`)*
* README + project documentation
* Filesystem writer for artifact creation

> The domain depends on nothing — adapters depend on the domain.

### Available Options (`springboot`)

| Option           | Required | Default    | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | -------- |------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--group-id`     | ✔        | –          | Maven `groupId`                                           |
| `--artifact-id`  | ✔        | –          | Maven `artifactId` (also becomes the project folder name) |
| `--name`         | ✔        | –          | Human-readable project name                               |
| `--description`  | ✔        | –          | Project description (minimum 10 characters)               |
| `--package-name` | ✔        | –          | Base Java package name                                    |
| `--build-tool`   | ✖        | `maven`    | Build tool (currently only `maven`)                       |
| `--language`     | ✖        | `java`     | Programming language (currently only `java`)              |
| `--java`         | ✖        | `21`       | Java version (21, 25) — GA target: 21                     |
| `--boot`         | ✖        | `3.5`      | Spring Boot version (3.4, 3.5) — GA target: 3.5           |
| `--layout`       | ✖        | `standard` | `standard` (layered) or `hexagonal` (ports & adapters)    |
| `--guardrails`  | ✖        | `basic`    | Architecture guardrails: `none`, `basic`, `strict`       |
| `--sample-code`  | ✖        | `none`     | Sample code level: `none`, `basic`                        |
| `--dependency`   | ✖        | –          | Dependency alias (repeatable, controlled set)             |
| `--target-dir`   | ✖        | `.`        | Target directory for generated output                     |

---

### Dependency Aliases (Controlled)

> Available dependency aliases are **intentionally limited** and mapped internally
> to well-known Spring Boot starters.
>
> This avoids uncontrolled dependency sprawl and keeps generated projects aligned
> with the **architecture-first** philosophy of Codegen Blueprint.

**Available aliases in 1.0.0:**

```
web
data_jpa
validation
actuator
security
devtools
```

Invalid or unknown aliases will fail fast during CLI execution.

> `--dependency` is **repeatable**. Multiple aliases may be specified:
>
> ```bash
> --dependency web --dependency actuator --dependency data_jpa
> ```

---

### Why This Matters

Codegen Blueprint is **not** a free-form dependency injector.

Dependencies are:

* explicitly modeled
* version-aligned with the selected platform
* constrained by design

This ensures generated projects start with:

* a clean dependency graph
* predictable behavior
* architecture-safe defaults

> Dependency freedom is a runtime concern —
> **architectural intent is a generation-time concern.**

---

### Generated Output (Simplified)

> The output directory name **always equals `--artifact-id`**.

```
greeting/
 ├── pom.xml
 ├── .gitignore
 ├── .mvn/
 │   └── wrapper/
 │       └── maven-wrapper.properties
 ├── src/
 │   ├── main/
 │   │   ├── java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/...
 │   │   └── resources/application.yml
 │   └── test/
 │       └── java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/...
```

This output is:

* buildable (`mvn verify`)
* testable (unit + integration baseline)
* architecture‑aware by construction

---

### Layout Semantics

**`standard` layout**

```
controller/
service/
repository/
domain/
config/
```

**`hexagonal` layout**

```
domain/
application/
adapter/
bootstrap/
```

No Spring annotations are placed inside the domain when hexagonal layout is selected.

---

### Architecture Guardrails & Feedback Loop

Architecture guardrails in Codegen Blueprint are **opt-in** and designed to create
a **fast, explicit feedback loop** during development — while context is still fresh.

They do not replace design decisions or reviews;  
they make architectural boundaries **visible, testable, and hard to miss**.

| Mode     | Behavior                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | No architectural checks generated                       |
| `basic`  | Generated ArchUnit checks for core structural boundaries|
| `strict` | Stricter dependency and layering checks                 |

When enabled, these checks are generated as **executable ArchUnit tests** under:

---

### Important Notes

* Codegen Blueprint does **not** generate cross-cutting behavior (security, logging, observability, etc.)
* Those concerns are intended to be **delivered and governed via shared libraries** in later Blueprint Platform phases
* Generated projects are intentionally minimal, stable, and architecture-first by design

> Codegen Blueprint optimizes for **long-term architectural integrity**,  
> not short-term scaffolding volume or feature breadth.

---

This section documents **what Codegen Blueprint produces today** —  
no demos, no aspirational features, no placeholders.

---
## 🧪 Testing & CI (This Repository)

The following describes the **CI pipeline of the Codegen Blueprint repository itself** —
**not** the projects generated by the CLI.

It validates both:

* the **generator engine** (domain, application, adapter)
* the **real output** produced by the generator (standard & hexagonal)

---

### Local Verification

```bash
mvn verify
```

This runs the full build lifecycle, including unit tests, integration tests, and architecture rules.

---

### CI Pipeline — Build & Test

The GitHub Actions workflow executes a **matrix build** to ensure compatibility, determinism,
and architectural integrity across supported Java versions.

**Key characteristics:**

* Runs on every `push` to `main` and all pull requests
* Tests **multiple JDKs** in parallel (Java 21 and Java 25)
* Verifies **generated projects**, not only the generator engine

---

### What the CI Pipeline Verifies

* ✔ Generator unit & integration tests
* ✔ Architectural rules validating the **generator itself** (ArchUnit)
* ✔ Generated projects are evaluated using `mvn verify`
* ✔ Layout coverage: **hexagonal** and **standard (layered)**
* ✔ Guardrails mode coverage: **strict**
* ✔ Output coverage: **sample basic** and **no-sample**
* ✔ JDK matrix coverage: **Java 21** and **Java 25**
* ✔ Total verification: **4 generated projects per JDK** (8 projects per CI run)
* ✔ Code coverage aggregation and reporting

---

### CI Execution Flow (Simplified)

```text
Checkout repository
→ Build & test generator (mvn clean verify)
→ Generate & verify (mvn verify) 4 projects:
   - hexagonal + strict + sample basic
   - standard  + strict + sample basic
   - hexagonal + strict + no sample
   - standard  + strict + no sample
→ Repeat across JDK matrix (21, 25)
→ Upload coverage reports
```

---

### Coverage & Static Analysis

The pipeline includes:

* **JaCoCo** — unit + integration test coverage
* **CodeQL** — static security analysis
* **Codecov** — aggregated coverage reporting

> These checks ensure the **generator itself** and its **generated output** remain stable,
> buildable, and architecture-safe as the platform evolves.

---

### Why This Matters

This CI setup explicitly prevents the class of failures where:

> *“The generator build is green, but the generated project is broken.”*

By evaluating **real generated projects** across layouts, guardrails modes, and JDK versions,
Codegen Blueprint treats architectural guarantees as **continuously verified contracts** —
not one-time scaffolding assumptions.

---

## 🚀 Vision & Roadmap

> Architecture should **execute**, not merely be drawn.  
> And it should remain observable and verifiable — even 6, 12, 24 months later.

### 🌟 The Vision

**Blueprint Platform** =  
🔹 Architecture-as-a-Product  
🔹 Capabilities delivered via libraries and governance  
🔹 Consistency that survives time and team changes

From Day Zero to Production — architecture remains **intentional**, **testable**, and **continuously evaluated**.

---

### 🧭 Roadmap Principles (Order Matters)

Blueprint evolves in intentional layers — to protect its core promise and avoid premature surface expansion.

Each phase builds on proven contracts and executable proof, not assumptions.

1. **Strengthen the contract & proof**  
   (determinism, architecture guardrails, reproducible demos)
2. **Add new delivery surfaces**  
   (CLI today → REST tomorrow) **without changing the core engine**
3. **Introduce capabilities via libraries + governance**  
   (standardize behavior, don’t copy-paste it)
4. **Expand profiles cautiously**  
   (Gradle/Kotlin/etc. increase surface area — scheduled after proof maturity)

> 📌 Ordering matters.  
> Capabilities and profiles are introduced **only after** architectural intent is proven executable.

---

### 🎯 Roadmap

#### 🔹 Phase 1 — Architecture-First Generation (Today)

This phase establishes the **executable architectural foundation**.

* Hexagonal / Standard (Layered) project generation (opt-in)
* Architecture guardrails via **generated ArchUnit checks**  
  (`none | basic | strict`)
* CLI-driven, profile-based generation  
  (Spring Boot · Maven · Java 21)
* Framework-free domain core by construction
* End-to-end **buildable output** evaluated in CI  
  (generated projects verified with `mvn verify`)

📌 **1.0.0 GA Objective** → Zero-drift architectural foundations + executable proof

---

#### 🔹 Phase 2 — New Delivery Surface (Planned)

This phase expands **access**, not responsibility.

The core engine remains unchanged.

* REST inbound adapter  
  (same architecture engine, new entry point)
* Interactive onboarding / configuration UX  
  (still contract-first)
* Safer defaults and clearer intent capture  
  (without widening the domain surface)

📌 Goal → expand accessibility **without rewriting the core**

---

#### 🔹 Phase 3 — Capability-Driven Architecture (Planned)

This phase operates at the **Blueprint Platform level**,  
not inside the generator itself.

Cross-cutting concerns are **not generated as boilerplate code**.  
They are delivered as **versioned capabilities**, governed and upgraded consistently across services.

`codegen-blueprint` acts as the **entry point and wiring engine**, enabling teams to **adopt, configure, and govern** these capabilities — not to implement them.

Planned capability areas include:

* 🔐 Security capability  
  (OAuth2 / Keycloak)
* 🔍 Observability capability  
  (tracing, logs, metrics)
* 📡 Resilience capability  
  (retries, timeouts, policies)
* 🏛️ Architecture policy packs  
  (versioned guardrails rulesets applied consistently across services)
* 🧩 Optional enterprise service kits  
  (API / Domain / Infra)
* 🔁 Generics-aware OpenAPI clients  
  (separate Blueprint module)

📌 Goal → consistent behavior, architectural boundaries, and upgrades  
**in one place — not duplicated across services**

---

#### 🔹 Phase 4 — Profile Expansion (Roadmap)

Profiles accelerate adoption but **increase surface area**  
(templates, tests, compatibility, support).

They are introduced only after architectural contracts and governance mature.

* Gradle support (profile)
* Kotlin support  
  (higher surface area than Gradle)
* Quarkus and future stack profiles
* Visual UI — configure → generate → download
* Governance at scale  
  (drift detection & remediation ideas)
* Platform telemetry for architecture health (opt-in)

📌 Goal → expand stacks **after** proof and contracts are stable

### 🧩 Why this matters

| Without Blueprint | With Blueprint |
|------------------|----------------|
| Architecture drifts silently | Guardrails make drift visible |
| Boilerplate everywhere | Capabilities delivered via libraries |
| Onboarding takes weeks | Day-zero structure + contracts |
| Standards depend on discipline | Standards made observable by construction |

> 📌 The platform grows → Projects stay clean → Enterprise stays consistent

**Blueprint Platform isn’t just code generation —  
it is strategic architectural continuity.**
