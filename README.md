> **Codegen Blueprint** is for teams who care less about *how fast a project starts*  
> and more about *how well its architecture survives over time*.

---

### 🤔 Should I clone this repository?

Clone this project if you’ve ever seen a codebase start clean and slowly drift into chaos —
where architectural rules exist only in slides, not in code.
**Codegen Blueprint is not a faster way to scaffold a project;**
it is a deliberate way to *lock architectural intent into executable, testable constraints*
from day zero.
If long-term maintainability, domain purity, and enforced boundaries matter to you,
this repo is worth your time.

---

### 🛡 1.0.0 Non-Negotiable Promise

**Every project generated by Codegen Blueprint 1.0.0 ships with enforceable architectural guardrails —**
not documentation, not conventions, but **executable rules that fail your build when architecture drifts**.

## 🧭 Architecture as a Product

Most teams don’t fail because they chose the wrong framework.  
They fail because **architecture slowly drifts once the project is “up and running.”**

What starts as a clean design turns into:
- shortcuts under delivery pressure
- blurred boundaries between layers
- domain logic leaking into frameworks
- “we’ll fix it later” decisions that never get fixed

Traditional project generators help you **start fast** —  
but they disappear the moment the first commit is made.

**Codegen Blueprint exists to solve what happens *after* generation.**

It treats architecture as a **first-class, executable product**:

* Enforces architectural boundaries — layered and/or Hexagonal (opt-in)
* Prevents silent architecture drift
* Protects the domain from frameworks by construction
* Standardizes early decisions across teams — automatically

> **Executable Architecture — Delivered from day zero. Enforced over time.**

### 🥇 What makes it different?

### 🧩 Generate vs Enforce (Cross‑Cutting Concerns)

Most generators **generate code** for cross‑cutting concerns.
That approach does not scale.

**Codegen Blueprint makes a clear distinction:**

| Approach              | What happens                                               | Long‑term effect                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Generate code         | Copies security, logging, error handling into each service | ❌ Drift, copy‑paste, painful upgrades        |
| Enforce via libraries | Centralized, versioned, opt‑in behavior                    | **✔ Consistency, easy upgrades, governance** |

> **Not everything should be generated.**
> Cross‑cutting concerns should be **enforced**, not duplicated.

With Blueprint Platform:

* Architecture is generated once
* Behavior is enforced via **shared libraries / BOMs**
* Upgrades happen in **one place**, not 50 microservices

This is why Blueprint is not a template collection.

> **It is architecture as an executable product.**

---

> 🧩 Same simplicity — **better long‑term alignment**

## ⚡ What is Codegen Blueprint (Today)?

A **CLI-driven**, **profile-based**, **architecture-aware** project generator
that turns architectural decisions into **executable output**.

📌 Current profile: **spring-boot-maven-java**

> Spring Boot 3.5+ · Java 21 · Maven — production-ready baseline

Codegen Blueprint today delivers:

* Deterministic, production-ready project scaffolding
* Clean source layout (main + test) with verified bootstrapping
* **Framework-free domain core by construction**
* Profile-driven architecture selection (standard / hexagonal)
* **Optional architecture enforcement via generated ArchUnit tests**
  *(enabled with `--enforcement basic|strict`)*
* Maven configuration, wrapper, and build baseline
* Application configuration (`application.yml`)
* Optional **Hexagonal teaching sample** (domain + ports + adapters)

> Architecture is not only generated —  
> it can be **verified and enforced as part of the project output**.

### 🧩 Part of the Blueprint Platform

`codegen-blueprint` is the first foundational module of the **Blueprint Platform** — an architecture‑first project generation ecosystem designed to enable consistent, enforceable, and scalable enterprise development.

Unlike traditional generators that simply scaffold code, Blueprint Platform aims to:

* **Standardize enterprise best practices** through opinionated architecture and code structure
* **Integrate reusable common libraries** that encapsulate cross‑cutting concerns (security, logging, error handling, tracing, OpenAPI clients, etc.)
* **Enforce architectural integrity** using built‑in validation and guardrails (e.g., hexagonal boundaries, naming rules, testable layout)

As the platform evolves, more modules will be introduced to complement `codegen-blueprint` with:

* Ready‑to‑use behavior‑driven libraries
* Consistent and generics‑aware OpenAPI client generation
* Support for multiple frameworks and technology stacks

🔗 Learn more at the [Blueprint Platform GitHub Organization](https://github.com/blueprint-platform)

> This aligns with the upcoming **Vision & Roadmap** section below.


> **Domain stays clean — Ports and adapters connect everything else.**

```
domain       // business logic only
application  // orchestrates ports
adapters     // inbound/outbound driven by use cases
bootstrap    // Spring wiring + config
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/architecture/architecture-overview.png" width="860" />
  <br/>
  <em>CLI → Use case layer → Domain → Artifacts → Spring Boot project</em>
</p>

### Guarantees

* **No Spring annotations inside the domain**
* **Hexagonal from day zero — when opted‑in**
* Flexible to evolve with future profiles (CQRS, Layered…)

## 🔌 Inbound & Outbound Adapters

Adapters drive interactions **in** and **out** of the core domain — keeping domain logic isolated and testable.

### Inbound (Delivery) — How requests enter

| Adapter | Status     | Description                                          |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI    | ✔ GA Ready | Primary driver to generate services via command-line |
| REST   | 🚧 Planned | Future interactive generation + onboarding UX        |

### Outbound (Artifacts) — What the engine produces

> Architecture enforcement artifacts are generated, not hard-wired

Everything required to **build → run → extend** a real service:

* Maven POM + Wrapper
* Main & Test source structure
* Domain + Application + Adapter layout
* Application configuration (YAML)
* Optional Hexagonal sample slice
* Optional **architecture enforcement tests (ArchUnit)**  
  *(enabled via `--enforcement basic|strict`)*
* README + project documentation
* Filesystem writer for artifact creation

> The domain depends on nothing — adapters depend on the domain.

## 🚀 Vision & Roadmap

> Architecture should **execute**, not merely be drawn.  
> And it should stay enforced — even 6, 12, 24 months later.

### 🌟 The Vision

**Blueprint Platform** =  
🔹 Architecture-as-a-Product  
🔹 Reusable Behavior Libraries  
🔹 Enforced Consistency Across Teams

From Day Zero to Production — architecture remains **intentional**, **testable**, and **aligned**.

---

### 🎯 Roadmap

#### 🔹 Phase 1 — Architecture-First Generation (Today)
* Hexagonal / Layered architecture enforcement (opt-in)
* **Optional architecture enforcement via generated ArchUnit tests**
* Profile-driven CLI generation (Spring Boot · Maven · Java 21)
* Domain purity: **no Spring inside the core**
* End-to-end testable scaffolding

📌 **1.0.0 GA Objective** → Zero-drift architectural foundations

---

#### 🔹 Phase 2 — Reusable Enterprise Behavior (In Progress)
* 🔐 Security defaults (OAuth2 / Keycloak)
* 📡 Resilience / Retries / Standardized error handling
* 🔍 Observability: tracing + logs + metrics — auto-wired
* 🧩 Multi-module enterprise service kits (API + Domain + Infra)
* Generics-aware OpenAPI client generation

📌 Libraries become **switch-on features**, not generated boilerplate

---

#### 🔹 Phase 3 — Ecosystem Expansion (Roadmap)
* Gradle & Kotlin support
* Quarkus + future stack profiles
* Visual UI — configure → generate → download
* Drift detection & auto-remediation (governance at scale)
* Platform telemetry for architecture health

📌 Community-driven priorities →  
🔗 Participate: [Discussions](https://github.com/blueprint-platform/codegen-blueprint/discussions)

### 🧩 Why this matters

| Without Blueprint | With Blueprint |
|------------------|----------------|
| Architecture drifts silently | Guardrails keep intent executable |
| Boilerplate everywhere | Cross-cutting concerns via libraries |
| Onboarding takes weeks | Day-zero productivity |
| Standards depend on discipline | Standards enforced by construction |

> 📌 The platform grows → Projects stay clean → Enterprise stays consistent
