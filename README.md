> **Codegen Blueprint** is for teams who care less about *how fast a project starts*  
> and more about *how well its architecture survives over time*.

---

### 🤔 Should I clone this repository?

Clone this project if you’ve ever seen a codebase start clean and slowly drift into chaos —
where architectural rules exist only in slides, not in code.

**Codegen Blueprint is not a faster way to scaffold a project.**
It is a deliberate way to **lock architectural intent into executable, testable constraints**
that are **continuously verified in CI** from day zero.

It doesn’t just generate a project —  
it generates a project **and proves, on every build, that the architecture still holds**.

If long-term maintainability, domain purity, and *build-time enforced boundaries* matter to you,
this repository is worth your time.

---

### 🛡 1.0.0 Non-Negotiable Promise

**Every project generated by Codegen Blueprint 1.0.0 ships with the ability to generate enforceable guardrails —**
not documentation, not conventions, but **executable rules that fail your build when architecture drifts**.

## Release & Compatibility Discipline

Codegen Blueprint follows an explicit **release discipline** where versions represent
**architectural and compatibility contracts**, not feature counts.
Starting from **1.0.0 GA**, guarantees around generation determinism, structure,
and executable architecture enforcement are intentional and protected.

Breaking changes are introduced **only in major versions** and are never silent.
For details, see:  
👉 [Release Discipline](docs/policies/release-discipline.md)

### What We Explicitly Do NOT Guarantee

Codegen Blueprint is intentionally **constrained by design**.
Some things are not supported — not by accident, but to protect architectural integrity.

Before adopting the project, please review what is **explicitly out of scope**:  
👉 [What We Do NOT Guarantee](docs/policies/what-we-do-not-guarantee.md)

### 🧾 Project History (Short)

Codegen Blueprint started as an early experiment in Spring Boot project bootstrapping (`codegen-springboot-initializr`).
As the project evolved, the focus shifted from “scaffolding” to **Executable Architecture** — guardrails that can fail the build.
The current `main` branch reflects this pivot and the architecture-first direction.
Earlier `0.x` tags are kept for historical context and experimentation, but they do **not** define the GA guarantees.
**The compatibility and guarantee contract begins with 1.0.0 GA.**

## 🧭 Architecture as a Product

Most teams don’t fail because they chose the wrong framework.  
They fail because **architecture slowly drifts once the project is “up and running.”**

What starts as a clean design turns into:
- shortcuts under delivery pressure
- blurred boundaries between layers
- domain logic leaking into frameworks
- “we’ll fix it later” decisions that never get fixed

Traditional project generators help you **start fast** —  
but they disappear the moment the first commit is made.

**Codegen Blueprint exists to solve what happens *after* generation.**

It treats architecture as a **first-class, executable product**:

* Enforces architectural boundaries — layered and/or Hexagonal (opt-in)
* Prevents silent architecture drift
* Protects the domain from frameworks by construction
* Standardizes early decisions across teams — automatically

> **Executable Architecture — Delivered from day zero. Enforced over time.**

### 🧩 Generate vs Enforce (Cross‑Cutting Concerns)

Most generators **generate code** for cross‑cutting concerns.
That approach does not scale.

**Codegen Blueprint makes a clear distinction:**

| Approach              | What happens                                               | Long‑term effect                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Generate code         | Copies security, logging, error handling into each service | ❌ Drift, copy‑paste, painful upgrades        |
| Enforce via libraries | Centralized, versioned, opt‑in behavior                    | **✔ Consistency, easy upgrades, governance** |

> **Not everything should be generated.**
> Cross‑cutting concerns should be **enforced**, not duplicated.

With Blueprint Platform:

* Architecture is generated once
* Behavior is enforced via **shared libraries / BOMs**
* Upgrades happen in **one place**, not 50 microservices

This is why Blueprint is not a template collection.

> **It is architecture as an executable product.**

---

> 🧩 Same simplicity — **better long‑term alignment**

## ⚡ What is Codegen Blueprint (Today)?

A **CLI-driven**, **profile-based**, **architecture-aware** project generator
that turns architectural decisions into **executable output**.

📌 Current profile: **spring-boot-maven-java**

> Spring Boot 3.5+ · Java 21 · Maven — production-ready baseline

Codegen Blueprint today delivers:

* Deterministic, production-ready project scaffolding
* Clean source layout (main + test) with verified bootstrapping
* **Framework-free domain core by construction**
* Profile-driven architecture selection (standard / hexagonal)
* Optional architecture enforcement via generated ArchUnit tests  
  *(enabled with `--enforcement basic|strict`)*
* Maven configuration, wrapper, and build baseline
* Application configuration (`application.yml`)
* Optional **basic sample code** for both:
    * **standard (layered)** layout
    * **hexagonal (ports & adapters)** layout

> Architecture is not only generated —  
> it can be **verified and enforced as part of the project output**.

---

### 🧪 Executable Architecture — Proof

Codegen Blueprint does not rely on conventions or documentation to protect architecture.

When strict enforcement is enabled, architectural boundaries are translated into
**generated, executable rules** that are evaluated during the build.

👉 **See the full step-by-step executable architecture proof:**  
[Executable Architecture Proof](docs/demo/executable-architecture-proof.md)

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Architecture isn’t only drawn — it executes here.

Hexagonal Architecture is not a stylistic choice in Codegen Blueprint.
It is a **structural requirement** for the platform’s core promise:

> **Generate once.  
> Evolve across frameworks, runtimes, and languages — without rewriting the core.**

Spring Boot is the first adapter — not the foundation.

### 🧩 Part of the Blueprint Platform

`codegen-blueprint` is the first foundational module of the **Blueprint Platform** — an architecture‑first project generation ecosystem designed to enable consistent, enforceable, and scalable enterprise development.

Unlike traditional generators that simply scaffold code, Blueprint Platform aims to:

* **Standardize enterprise best practices** through opinionated architecture and code structure
* **Integrate reusable common libraries** that encapsulate cross‑cutting concerns (security, logging, error handling, tracing, OpenAPI clients, etc.)
* **Enforce architectural integrity** using built‑in validation and guardrails (e.g., hexagonal boundaries, naming rules, testable layout)

As the platform evolves, more modules will be introduced to complement `codegen-blueprint` with:

* Ready‑to‑use behavior‑driven libraries
* Consistent and generics‑aware OpenAPI client generation
* Support for multiple frameworks and technology stacks

> This aligns with the upcoming **Vision & Roadmap** section below.


> **Domain stays clean — Ports and adapters connect everything else.**

```
domain       // business logic only
application  // orchestrates ports
adapter     // inbound/outbound driven by use cases
bootstrap   // Spring wiring + config
```

<p align="center">

  <br/>
  <em>CLI → Use case layer → Domain → Artifacts → Spring Boot project</em>
</p>

### Guarantees

* **No Spring annotations inside the domain**
* **Hexagonal from day zero — when opted‑in**
* Flexible to evolve with future profiles (CQRS, Layered…)

## 🔌 Inbound & Outbound Adapters

Adapters drive interactions **in** and **out** of the core domain — keeping domain logic isolated and testable.

### Inbound (Delivery) — How requests enter

| Adapter | Status     | Description                                          |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI    | ✔ GA Ready | Primary driver to generate services via command-line |
| REST   | 🚧 Planned | Future interactive generation + onboarding UX        |

### Outbound (Artifacts) — What the engine produces

> Architecture enforcement artifacts are generated, not hard-wired

Everything required to **build → run → extend** a real service:

* Maven POM + Wrapper
* Main & Test source structure
* Domain + Application + Adapter layout
* Application configuration (YAML)
* Optional **basic sample code**, depending on selected layout:
    * **standard (layered)** sample slice
    * **hexagonal (ports & adapters)** sample slice
* Optional **architecture enforcement tests (ArchUnit)**  
  *(enabled via `--enforcement basic|strict`)*
* README + project documentation
* Filesystem writer for artifact creation

> The domain depends on nothing — adapter depends on the domain.

```

---

### Available Options (`springboot`)

| Option           | Required | Default    | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------- |-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--group-id`     | ✔        | –          | Maven `groupId`                                           |
| `--artifact-id`  | ✔        | –          | Maven `artifactId` (also becomes the project folder name) |
| `--name`         | ✔        | –          | Human-readable project name                               |
| `--description`  | ✔        | –          | Project description (minimum 10 characters)               |
| `--package-name` | ✔        | –          | Base Java package name                                    |
| `--build-tool`   | ✖        | `maven`    | Build tool (currently only `maven`)                       |
| `--language`     | ✖        | `java`     | Programming language (currently only `java`)              |
| `--java`         | ✖        | `21`       | Java version (21, 25) — GA target: 21                     |
| `--boot`         | ✖        | `3.5`      | Spring Boot version (3.4, 3.5) — GA target: 3.5           |
| `--layout`       | ✖        | `standard` | `standard` (layered) or `hexagonal` (ports & adapters)    |
| `--enforcement`  | ✖        | `none`     | Architecture enforcement: `none`, `basic`, `strict`       |
| `--sample-code`  | ✖        | `none`     | Sample code level: `none`, `basic`                        |
| `--dependency`   | ✖        | –          | Dependency alias (repeatable, controlled set)             |
| `--target-dir`   | ✖        | `.`        | Target directory for generated output                     |

---

### Dependency Aliases (Controlled)

> Available dependency aliases are **intentionally limited** and mapped internally
> to well-known Spring Boot starters.
>
> This avoids uncontrolled dependency sprawl and keeps generated projects aligned
> with the **architecture-first** philosophy of Codegen Blueprint.

**Available aliases in 1.0.0:**

```
web
data_jpa
validation
actuator
security
devtools
```

Invalid or unknown aliases will fail fast during CLI execution.

---

### Why This Matters

Codegen Blueprint is **not** a free-form dependency injector.

Dependencies are:

* explicitly modeled
* version-aligned with the selected platform
* constrained by design

This ensures generated projects start with:

* a clean dependency graph
* predictable behavior
* architecture-safe defaults

> Dependency freedom is a runtime concern —
> **architectural intent is a generation-time concern.**

---

### Generated Output (Simplified)

> The output directory name **always equals `--artifact-id`**.

```
greeting/
 ├── pom.xml
 ├── .gitignore
 ├── .mvn/
 │   └── wrapper/
 │       └── maven-wrapper.properties
 ├── src/
 │   ├── main/
 │   │   ├── java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/...
 │   │   └── resources/application.yml
 │   └── test/
 │       └── java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/...
```

This output is:

* buildable (`mvn verify`)
* testable (unit + integration baseline)
* architecture‑aware by construction

---

### Layout Semantics

**`standard` layout**

```
controller/
service/
repository/
domain/
config/
```

**`hexagonal` layout**

```
domain/
application/
adapter/
bootstrap/
```

No Spring annotations are placed inside the domain when hexagonal layout is selected.

---

### Architecture Enforcement

Architecture enforcement is **opt‑in**:

| Mode     | Behavior                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | No architectural rules generated                   |
| `basic`  | Generated ArchUnit rules enforcing core boundaries |
| `strict` | Stricter dependency and layering rules             |

When enabled, enforcement rules are generated as **executable ArchUnit tests** under:

```
src/test/java/.../architecture/**
```

Violations fail the build deterministically during `mvn verify`.

---

### Important Notes

* Codegen Blueprint does **not** generate cross‑cutting behavior (security, logging, etc.)
* Those concerns are intended to be **enforced via shared libraries** in later Blueprint Platform phases
* Generated projects are intentionally minimal, stable, and architecture‑first

> Codegen Blueprint optimizes for **long‑term architectural integrity**, not short‑term scaffolding volume.

---

This section documents **what Codegen Blueprint actually produces today** — no demos, no exaggeration, no placeholders.

---
## 🧪 Testing & CI (This Repository)

The following describes the **CI pipeline of the Codegen Blueprint repository itself** —
**not** the projects generated by the CLI.

It validates both:

* the **generator engine** (domain, application, adapter)
* the **real output** produced by the generator (standard & hexagonal)

---

### Local Verification

```bash
mvn verify
```

This runs the full build lifecycle, including unit tests, integration tests, and architecture rules.

---

### CI Pipeline — Build & Test

The GitHub Actions workflow executes a **matrix build** to ensure compatibility, determinism,
and architectural integrity across supported Java versions.

**Key characteristics:**

* Runs on every `push` to `main` and all pull requests
* Tests **multiple JDKs** in parallel (Java 21 and Java 25)
* Verifies **generated projects**, not only the generator engine

---

### What the CI Pipeline Verifies

* ✔ Generator unit & integration tests
* ✔ Architecture enforcement rules inside the generator itself
* ✔ Generated projects are verified using `mvn verify`
* ✔ Layout coverage: **hexagonal** and **standard (layered)**
* ✔ Enforcement coverage: **strict**
* ✔ Output coverage: **sample basic** and **no-sample**
* ✔ JDK matrix coverage: **Java 21** and **Java 25**
* ✔ Total verification: **4 generated projects per JDK** (8 projects per CI run)
* ✔ Code coverage aggregation and reporting

---

### CI Execution Flow (Simplified)

```text
Checkout repository
→ Build & test generator (mvn clean verify)
→ Generate & verify (mvn verify) 4 projects:
   - hexagonal + strict + sample basic
   - standard  + strict + sample basic
   - hexagonal + strict + no sample
   - standard  + strict + no sample
→ Repeat across JDK matrix (21, 25)
→ Upload coverage reports
```

---

### Coverage & Static Analysis

The pipeline includes:

* **JaCoCo** — unit + integration test coverage
* **CodeQL** — static security analysis
* **Codecov** — aggregated coverage reporting

> These checks ensure the **generator itself** and its **generated output** remain stable,
> buildable, and architecture-safe as the platform evolves.

---

### Why This Matters

This CI setup explicitly prevents the class of failures where:

> *“The generator build is green, but the generated project is broken.”*

By validating **real generated projects** across layouts, enforcement modes, and JDK versions,
Codegen Blueprint treats architectural guarantees as **continuously verified contracts**,
not one-time scaffolding assumptions.


---

## 🚀 Vision & Roadmap

> Architecture should **execute**, not merely be drawn.  
> And it should stay enforced — even 6, 12, 24 months later.

### 🌟 The Vision

**Blueprint Platform** =  
🔹 Architecture-as-a-Product  
🔹 Reusable Behavior Libraries  
🔹 Enforced Consistency Across Teams

From Day Zero to Production — architecture remains **intentional**, **testable**, and **aligned**.

---

### 🎯 Roadmap

#### 🔹 Phase 1 — Architecture-First Generation (Today)
* Hexagonal / Layered architecture enforcement (opt-in)
* **Optional architecture enforcement via generated ArchUnit tests**
* Profile-driven CLI generation (Spring Boot · Maven · Java 21)
* Domain purity: **no Spring inside the core**
* End-to-end testable scaffolding

📌 **1.0.0 GA Objective** → Zero-drift architectural foundations

---

#### 🔹 Phase 2 — Reusable Enterprise Behavior (In Progress)
* 🔐 Security defaults (OAuth2 / Keycloak)
* 📡 Resilience / Retries / Standardized error handling
* 🔍 Observability: tracing + logs + metrics — auto-wired
* 🧩 Multi-module enterprise service kits (API + Domain + Infra)
* Generics-aware OpenAPI client generation

📌 Libraries become **switch-on features**, not generated boilerplate

---

#### 🔹 Phase 3 — Ecosystem Expansion (Roadmap)
* Gradle & Kotlin support
* Quarkus + future stack profiles
* Visual UI — configure → generate → download
* Drift detection & auto-remediation (governance at scale)
* Platform telemetry for architecture health

📌 Community-driven priorities →  
🔗 Participate: [Discussions](https://github.com/blueprint-platform/codegen-blueprint/discussions)

---

### 🧩 Why this matters

| Without Blueprint | With Blueprint |
|------------------|----------------|
| Architecture drifts silently | Guardrails keep intent executable |
| Boilerplate everywhere | Cross-cutting concerns via libraries |
| Onboarding takes weeks | Day-zero productivity |
| Standards depend on discipline | Standards enforced by construction |

> 📌 The platform grows → Projects stay clean → Enterprise stays consistent
