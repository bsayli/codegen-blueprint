## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build (fast feedback)
./mvnw clean package
```

```bash
# Verify architecture guardrails (recommended)
# Runs generated ArchUnit tests and fails fast on architectural violations
./mvnw verify
```

> **Why `mvn verify` matters**
>
> This project includes **generated architecture guardrails**
> that are evaluated at **build time**.
>
> Running `mvn verify` executes these guardrails and serves as
> the **proof of the architectural contract**.
>
> Any boundary violation will **fail the build immediately**.

```bash
# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> **macOS / Linux note**
>
> If you get a `permission denied` error when running `./mvnw`, make the wrapper executable:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x mvnw
> ```

> If Maven is installed globally, you may also use `mvn` instead of the wrapper.

> * `domain` contains pure business rules (framework-free)

## 🧩 Architecture Guardrails

> **Architecture Contract Notice**
>
> Architecture guardrails are evaluated **against the package structure generated by Codegen Blueprint**.
> The generated source layout is **part of the architectural contract**.
>
> Changing package names, moving components outside their generated boundaries, or restructuring layers
> may invalidate the guardrails and is considered a **contract violation**.
>
> **This contract is enforced by the generated architecture tests listed below.**

---

Architecture guardrails are **enabled (strict)**.

This project includes **strict, fail-fast architectural guardrails** generated as executable ArchUnit tests.

Any architectural drift will **break the build deterministically**.

### What strict guardrails evaluate

For **Hexagonal Architecture**, strict guardrails evaluate:

* **Dependency direction**
  * Application does not depend on adapters
  * Bootstrap is a dependency leaf

---

* **Adapter direction isolation**
  * Inbound adapters must not depend on outbound adapters
  * Outbound adapters must not depend on inbound adapters

---

* **Inbound adapter → domain isolation**
  * Inbound adapters must not depend on domain services
  * Inbound adapters must not depend on domain outbound ports

---

* **Domain purity**
  * Domain depends only on JDK types and other domain types

---

* **Ports isolation**
  * Adapters may depend only on application **ports**, not implementations

---

* **REST boundary isolation** (when `spring-boot-starter-web` is present)
  * REST controllers must not expose domain types in method signatures
  * Adapter DTOs must not depend on domain

---

* **Package cycle prevention**
  * No cyclic dependencies across top-level packages
  * No cycles inside adapter subpackages
### How guardrails work

* Rules are generated automatically based on:
  * selected **layout**
  * selected **guardrails mode**
  * selected **dependencies**

* Guardrails run at **build time only** — no runtime checks

```bash
# surfaces violations and fails fast
mvn verify
```

### Where the rules live

```text
src/test/java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/architecture/archunit/
```

> These rules are generated code.
> They represent the **architecture guardrails contract** selected at generation time.

## 🧪 Included Sample (Basic)

Because `--sample-code basic` was selected, the project includes a minimal
end-to-end **Greeting** slice.

The sample is intentionally isolated under a dedicated package to keep
your own application code clean and to make removal straightforward.

```text
io.github.blueprintplatform.greeting.bp.sample
```

This keeps user-owned packages clean and makes the sample removable as a single subtree.

### What this sample demonstrates

* an inbound **REST adapter**
* an application **use case** exposed via an **input port**
* domain + application models
* mapping of use case output to HTTP response DTOs

### Sample REST endpoints

Base path:

```text
/api/v1/sample/greetings
```

### Available endpoints

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings/default`

Returns a default greeting.

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John`

Returns a personalized greeting.

Example calls:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings/default | jq
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John" | jq
```

### Where to look in the code

Start here:

* **Inbound REST adapter**
  * `bp/sample/adapter/in/rest/GreetingController`

---

* **Application port (input)**
  * `bp/sample/application/port/in/GetGreetingPort`

---

* **Use case implementation**
  * `bp/sample/application/usecase/...`

---

* **Domain model + domain service**
  * `bp/sample/domain/model/...`
  * `bp/sample/domain/service/...`

You can use this sample in two ways:

* as a **teaching reference** for hexagonal boundaries
* as a **starting slice** you can copy/adapt into your own user-owned packages

## Scope & Intent

This generated project intentionally focuses on **structural correctness and observable architectural guardrails**.

Delivery concerns (CI/CD, containerization, deployment strategies) are left to the consuming team and platform standards.
