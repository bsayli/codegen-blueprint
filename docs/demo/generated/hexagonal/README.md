## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build (fast feedback)
./mvnw clean package
```

```bash
# Verify architecture guardrails (recommended)
# Runs generated ArchUnit tests and fails fast on architectural violations
./mvnw verify
```

> **Why `mvn verify` matters**
>
> This project includes **generated architecture guardrails**
> that are evaluated at **build time**.
>
> Running `mvn verify` executes these guardrails and serves as
> the **proof of the architectural contract**.
>
> Any boundary violation will **fail the build immediately**.

```bash
# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> **macOS / Linux note**
>
> If you get a `permission denied` error when running `./mvnw`, make the wrapper executable:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x mvnw
> ```

> If Maven is installed globally, you may also use `mvn` instead of the wrapper.

> This project follows **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**.
>
> * `domain` contains pure business rules (framework-free)
> * `application` orchestrates use cases and defines ports
>
>   * `application/port` defines inbound and outbound ports
>   * `application/usecase` contains use case implementations
> * `adapter` contains inbound/outbound implementations (REST, persistence, messaging)
> * `bootstrap` wires everything together

## 🧩 Architecture Guardrails

**Authoritative references**
  * **Authoritative Rule Reference (contract semantics):**
    * [Architecture Guardrails Rulebook](https://github.com/blueprint-platform/codegen-blueprint/blob/main/docs/architecture/architecture-guardrails-rulebook.md)
    _(Defines guardrails semantics, vocabulary, and versioning guarantees)_

  * **Canonical Vocabulary (generated contract surface):**
    * Hexagonal: `src/test/java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/architecture/archunit/HexagonalGuardrailsScope.java`

> **Architecture Contract Notice**
>
> Architecture guardrails are evaluated **strictly against the package structure generated by Codegen Blueprint**.
> The generated layout is **part of the architecture contract**.
>
> Refactors that rename canonical package families, move code outside detected bounded contexts,
> or introduce unexpected top-level families may be detected as **architecture drift** and fail the build.

### What guardrails are (and are not)

Guardrails are:

* **Generated** (not handwritten)
* **Executable** (evaluated as tests)
* **Deterministic** (same input → same outcome)
* **Build-time only** (no runtime checks)

They are **not**:

* Documentation
* Conventions
* Runtime safety nets

Guardrails exist to make architectural boundaries **observable, enforceable, and non-bypassable**.

---

### How to run guardrails

Guardrails are evaluated during:

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

---

### Where the generated rules live

```text
src/test/java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/architecture/archunit/
```

These tests are **generated code**. They represent the architecture contract selected at generation time.

---

### Guardrails categories

All guardrails fall into three categories:

1. **Dependency guardrails**

Control allowed and forbidden dependency directions between layers/components.

2. **Boundary guardrails**

Protect public boundaries (e.g., REST) from leaking internal or domain types.

3. **Schema & contract guardrails**

Protect the **meaning and scope** of guardrails by validating the package schema and bounded-context detection.

> Schema guardrails are critical: without them, dependency rules can be accidentally bypassed by refactoring package names.

---



### Guardrails status: enabled (`strict`)

**Strict** mode treats architecture as a **non-negotiable contract**.

Any structural drift, boundary leakage, or rename-based bypass will **fail the build deterministically**.

#### What strict guardrails enforce

Strict guardrails are generated **because this project was created with `--guardrails strict`**.

Strict mode enforces:

* **Full dependency direction contracts** (layout-specific)
  * Hexagonal: `application` must not depend on `adapter`; `bootstrap` remains a strict leaf
* **Domain purity**
  * Domain may depend only on **JDK types** and **other domain types**
  * No framework / delivery / persistence dependencies
* **Boundary isolation** (Spring Web only)
  * REST controllers must not expose domain types in method signatures
  * Boundary DTOs must not depend on domain types
* **Schema & rename enforcement**
  * Within each detected bounded context, classes must reside under the **canonical families**
  * This prevents silent bypass via package renaming or “unknown family” drift
* **Family-local cycle prevention**
  * Cycles are forbidden **inside each canonical family** (and adapter sub-families where applicable)

---

#### Hexagonal — Strict (Ports & Adapters)

**Dependency & direction**

* `application` must **not depend on** `adapter`
* `bootstrap` is a **strict leaf**

**Adapter isolation**

* `adapter.in` must **not depend on** `adapter.out`
* `adapter.out` must **not depend on** `adapter.in`

**Inbound adapter isolation**
  * `adapter.in` must **not depend on**:
    * `domain.service`
    * `domain.port.out`

**Application implementation isolation**
  * Adapters may depend only on **application ports** (`application.port..`)
  * Any dependency to application implementation packages is forbidden

**Domain purity**

* `domain` may depend only on:
  * JDK (`java.*`)
  * other domain types

**Schema & rename enforcement (contract integrity)**
  * Within each detected bounded context, classes must reside under the canonical families

* Within each detected bounded context, every class must reside under one of:
  * `adapter`
  * `application`
  * `domain`
  * `bootstrap`

**Cycle prevention (family-local)**

* No cyclic dependencies inside:
  * `adapter`, `application`, `domain`, `bootstrap`
* No cyclic dependencies inside:
  * `adapter.in..`, `adapter.out..`

**REST boundary isolation** (only when `spring-boot-starter-web` is present)

* `@RestController` under `adapter.in..` must not expose domain types in:
  * return types
  * parameters
  * generic signatures
* Inbound DTOs (`adapter.in..dto..`) must not depend on domain

---

#### Operational note

Strict mode is intentionally fail-fast.
If you want adoption-first enforcement with fewer constraints, use **Basic** instead.

## 🧪 Included Sample (Basic)

Because `--sample-code basic` was selected, the project includes a minimal
end-to-end **Greeting** slice.

The sample is intentionally isolated under a dedicated package to keep
your own application code clean and to make removal straightforward.

```text
io.github.blueprintplatform.greeting.bp.sample
```

This keeps user-owned packages clean and makes the sample removable as a single subtree.

### What this sample demonstrates

* an inbound **REST adapter**
* an application **use case** exposed via an **input port**
* domain + application models
* mapping of use case output to HTTP response DTOs

### Sample REST endpoints

Base path:

```text
/api/v1/sample/greetings
```

### Available endpoints

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings/default`

Returns a default greeting.

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John`

Returns a personalized greeting.

Example calls:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings/default | jq
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John" | jq
```

### Where to look in the code

Start here:

* **Inbound REST adapter**
  * `bp/sample/adapter/in/rest/GreetingController`

---

* **Application port (input)**
  * `bp/sample/application/port/in/GetGreetingPort`

---

* **Use case implementation**
  * `bp/sample/application/usecase/...`

---

* **Domain model + domain service**
  * `bp/sample/domain/model/...`
  * `bp/sample/domain/service/...`

You can use this sample in two ways:

* as a **teaching reference** for hexagonal boundaries
* as a **starting slice** you can copy/adapt into your own user-owned packages

## Scope & Intent

This generated project intentionally focuses on **structural correctness and observable architectural guardrails**.

Delivery concerns (CI/CD, containerization, deployment strategies) are left to the consuming team and platform standards.
