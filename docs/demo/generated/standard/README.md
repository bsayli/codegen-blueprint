## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build (fast feedback)
./mvnw clean package
```

```bash
# Verify architecture guardrails (recommended)
# Runs generated ArchUnit tests and fails fast on architectural violations
./mvnw verify
```

> **Why `mvn verify` matters**
>
> This project includes **generated architecture guardrails**
> that are evaluated at **build time**.
>
> Running `mvn verify` executes these guardrails and serves as
> the **proof of the architectural contract**.
>
> Any boundary violation will **fail the build immediately**.

```bash
# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> **macOS / Linux note**
>
> If you get a `permission denied` error when running `./mvnw`, make the wrapper executable:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x mvnw
> ```

> If Maven is installed globally, you may also use `mvn` instead of the wrapper.

## 🧩 Architecture Guardrails

> **Architecture Contract Notice**
>
> Architecture guardrails are evaluated **against the package structure generated by Codegen Blueprint**.
> The generated source layout is **part of the architectural contract**.
>
> Changing package names, moving components outside their generated boundaries, or restructuring layers
> may invalidate the guardrails and is considered a **contract violation**.
>
> **This contract is enforced by the generated architecture tests listed below.**

---

Architecture guardrails are **enabled (strict)**.

This project includes **strict, fail-fast architectural guardrails** generated as executable ArchUnit tests.

Any architectural drift will **break the build deterministically**.

### What strict guardrails evaluate

For **Standard (Layered) Architecture**, strict guardrails evaluate:

* **Layer dependency direction and bypass prevention**
  * Controllers must not depend on repositories
  * Controllers must not depend on domain services
  * Services must not depend on controllers
  * Repositories must not depend on services or controllers

---

* **Domain purity**
  * Domain depends only on JDK types and other domain types

---

* **REST boundary isolation** (when `spring-boot-starter-web` is present)
  * REST controllers must not expose domain types in method signatures
  * Controller DTOs must not depend on domain

---

* **Package cycle prevention**

* No cyclic dependencies between top-level packages
### How guardrails work

* Rules are generated automatically based on:
  * selected **layout**
  * selected **guardrails mode**
  * selected **dependencies**

* Guardrails run at **build time only** — no runtime checks

```bash
# surfaces violations and fails fast
mvn verify
```

### Where the rules live

```text
src/test/java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/architecture/archunit/
```

> These rules are generated code.
> They represent the **architecture guardrails contract** selected at generation time.

## 🧪 Included Sample (Basic)

Because `--sample-code basic` was selected, the project includes a minimal
end-to-end **Greeting** slice that demonstrates a classic
**standard (layered) architecture** in its simplest, most readable form.

This sample is intentionally small.
Its purpose is **not** to showcase advanced patterns,
but to provide a clear baseline for how layers collaborate
in a traditional Spring Boot application.

The sample is intentionally isolated under a dedicated package
to keep your own application code clean and to make removal straightforward.

```text
io.github.blueprintplatform.greeting.bp.sample
```

This keeps user-owned packages clean and makes the sample removable as a single subtree.

### What this sample demonstrates

* an inbound **REST controller**
* an **application/service layer** orchestrating a use case
* a **pure domain model** (no Spring, no IO)
* a simple **audit side effect** triggered after the use case
* mapping from domain objects to HTTP response DTOs

The flow is deliberately straightforward:

```text
HTTP → Controller → Service → Domain → Service → Controller → DTO
```

This makes the sample easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to evolve.

### Sample REST endpoints

Base path:

```text
/api/v1/sample/greetings
```

### Available endpoints

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings/default`

Returns a default greeting.

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John`

Returns a personalized greeting.

Example calls:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings/default | jq
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John" | jq
```

### Where to look in the code

To understand the sample, start with these classes:

* **REST controller**
  * `bp/sample/controller/GreetingController`

---

* **Application / use-case service**
  * `bp/sample/service/GreetingService`

---

* **Pure domain logic**
  * `bp/sample/domain/service/GreetingDomainService`
  * `bp/sample/domain/model/Greeting`

---

* **Audit side effect**
  * `bp/sample/repository/GreetingAuditRepository`

Each layer has a single, focused responsibility and communicates only with the layer directly below it.

### How to use this sample

You can use this sample in two ways:

* as a **baseline reference** for a standard layered Spring Boot project
* as a **starting point** to gradually introduce more advanced concepts
(transactions, persistence, messaging, or even a future migration to hexagonal architecture)

This sample is intentionally conservative by design.
It favors clarity over abstraction, and explicit flow over indirection.

## Scope & Intent

This generated project intentionally focuses on **structural correctness and observable architectural guardrails**.

Delivery concerns (CI/CD, containerization, deployment strategies) are left to the consuming team and platform standards.
