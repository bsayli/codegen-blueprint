## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build (fast feedback)
./mvnw clean package
```

```bash
# Verify architecture guardrails (recommended)
# Runs generated ArchUnit tests and fails fast on architectural violations
./mvnw verify
```

> **Why `mvn verify` matters**
>
> This project includes **generated architecture guardrails**
> that are evaluated at **build time**.
>
> Running `mvn verify` executes these guardrails and serves as
> the **proof of the architectural contract**.
>
> Any boundary violation will **fail the build immediately**.

```bash
# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> **macOS / Linux note**
>
> If you get a `permission denied` error when running `./mvnw`, make the wrapper executable:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x mvnw
> ```

> If Maven is installed globally, you may also use `mvn` instead of the wrapper.

> This project follows a **Standard Layered Architecture**.
>
> * `controller` handles HTTP/API requests (including `controller/dto` boundary models)
> * `service` contains orchestration / application services
> * `repository` manages persistence and side effects
> * `domain` holds core domain models and domain services
> * `config` contains application and framework configuration

## 🧩 Architecture Guardrails

> **Architecture Contract Notice**
>
> Architecture guardrails are evaluated **strictly against the package structure generated by Codegen Blueprint**.
> The generated source layout is **part of the architectural contract itself**.
>
> Renaming packages, introducing new top-level families, or relocating components
> without updating the contract will be detected as **architecture drift**.
>
> **This contract is enforced by generated, build-time architecture tests.**

---

### What guardrails are (and are not)

Architecture guardrails are:

* **Generated** (not handwritten)
* **Executable** (evaluated as tests)
* **Deterministic** (same input → same outcome)
* **Build-time only** (no runtime checks)

They are **not**:

* Documentation
* Conventions
* Runtime safety nets

Guardrails exist to make architectural boundaries **observable, enforceable, and non-bypassable**.

---

### Guardrails categories

All guardrails fall into three distinct categories:

1. **Dependency guardrails**
Enforce allowed and forbidden dependency directions between layers and components.

2. **Boundary guardrails**
Protect public boundaries (e.g. REST) from leaking internal or domain types.

3. **Schema & contract guardrails**
Ensure that the **structural contract itself remains valid** and cannot be silently bypassed.

> Schema guardrails are critical: without them, dependency rules can be accidentally disabled
> by refactoring package names or moving code outside the expected structure.

---

### Guardrails status: enabled (strict)

Strict mode treats architecture as a **non-negotiable contract**.

Any structural drift, boundary leakage, or rename-based bypass
will **fail the build deterministically**.

---

#### What strict guardrails enforce

In addition to all basic guardrails, strict mode enforces:

* Full dependency direction contracts
* Public boundary isolation
* Domain purity
* Package cycle prevention
* **Schema & rename enforcement**

---

### Standard / Layered (Strict)

**Layer dependency enforcement**
  * Controllers must not depend on repositories
  * Controllers must not depend on domain services
  * Services must not depend on controllers
  * Repositories must not depend on services or controllers

---

**Domain purity**
  * Domain may depend only on:
    * JDK types
    * Other domain types

---

**Schema & rename enforcement**
  Within each detected bounded context, every class must reside under
  one of the canonical layered families:
  * `controller`
  * `service`
  * `repository`
  * `domain`
  * `config`

Packages outside detected bounded contexts are not restricted.

---

**Package cycle prevention**
  * No cyclic dependencies inside:
    * controller
    * service
    * repository
    * domain
    * config

---

**REST boundary isolation** (when `spring-boot-starter-web` is present)
  * REST controllers must not expose domain types in:
    * return types
    * parameters
    * generic signatures

  * Controller DTOs must not depend on domain

---

#### How strict guardrails are evaluated

* Rules are generated automatically based on:
  * selected **layout**
  * selected **guardrails mode**
  * selected **dependencies**

* Guardrails run **only at build time**:

```bash
mvn verify
```

Any violation fails the build — clearly, early, and on purpose.

---

#### Where the rules live

```text
src/test/java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/architecture/archunit/
```

> These tests are generated code.
> They represent the **architecture guardrails contract** selected at generation time.

## 🧪 Included Sample (Basic)

Because `--sample-code basic` was selected, the project includes a minimal
end-to-end **Greeting** slice that demonstrates a classic
**standard (layered) architecture** in its simplest, most readable form.

This sample is intentionally small.
Its purpose is **not** to showcase advanced patterns,
but to provide a clear baseline for how layers collaborate
in a traditional Spring Boot application.

The sample is intentionally isolated under a dedicated package
to keep your own application code clean and to make removal straightforward.

```text
io.github.blueprintplatform.greeting.bp.sample
```

This keeps user-owned packages clean and makes the sample removable as a single subtree.

### What this sample demonstrates

* an inbound **REST controller**
* an **application/service layer** orchestrating a use case
* a **pure domain model** (no Spring, no IO)
* a simple **audit side effect** triggered after the use case
* mapping from domain objects to HTTP response DTOs

The flow is deliberately straightforward:

```text
HTTP → Controller → Service → Domain → Service → Controller → DTO
```

This makes the sample easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to evolve.

### Sample REST endpoints

Base path:

```text
/api/v1/sample/greetings
```

### Available endpoints

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings/default`

Returns a default greeting.

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John`

Returns a personalized greeting.

Example calls:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings/default | jq
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John" | jq
```

### Where to look in the code

To understand the sample, start with these classes:

* **REST controller**
  * `bp/sample/controller/GreetingController`

---

* **Application / use-case service**
  * `bp/sample/service/GreetingService`

---

* **Pure domain logic**
  * `bp/sample/domain/service/GreetingDomainService`
  * `bp/sample/domain/model/Greeting`

---

* **Audit side effect**
  * `bp/sample/repository/GreetingAuditRepository`

Each layer has a single, focused responsibility and communicates only with the layer directly below it.

### How to use this sample

You can use this sample in two ways:

* as a **baseline reference** for a standard layered Spring Boot project
* as a **starting point** to gradually introduce more advanced concepts
(transactions, persistence, messaging, or even a future migration to hexagonal architecture)

This sample is intentionally conservative by design.
It favors clarity over abstraction, and explicit flow over indirection.

## Scope & Intent

This generated project intentionally focuses on **structural correctness and observable architectural guardrails**.

Delivery concerns (CI/CD, containerization, deployment strategies) are left to the consuming team and platform standards.
