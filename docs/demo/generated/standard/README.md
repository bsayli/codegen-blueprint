## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build (fast feedback)
./mvnw clean package
```

```bash
# Verify architecture guardrails (recommended)
# Runs generated ArchUnit tests and fails fast on architectural violations
./mvnw verify
```

> **Why `mvn verify` matters**
>
> This project includes **generated architecture guardrails**
> that are evaluated at **build time**.
>
> Running `mvn verify` executes these guardrails and serves as
> the **proof of the architectural contract**.
>
> Any boundary violation will **fail the build immediately**.

```bash
# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> **macOS / Linux note**
>
> If you get a `permission denied` error when running `./mvnw`, make the wrapper executable:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x mvnw
> ```

> If Maven is installed globally, you may also use `mvn` instead of the wrapper.

## 🧩 Architecture Guardrails

**Authoritative references**
  * **Authoritative Rule Reference (contract semantics):**
    * [Architecture Guardrails Rulebook](https://github.com/blueprint-platform/codegen-blueprint/blob/main/docs/architecture/architecture-guardrails-rulebook.md)
    _(Defines guardrails semantics, vocabulary, and versioning guarantees)_

  * **Canonical Vocabulary (generated contract surface):**
    * Standard: `src/test/java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/architecture/archunit/StandardGuardrailsScope.java`

> **Architecture Contract Notice**
>
> Architecture guardrails are evaluated **strictly against the package structure generated by Codegen Blueprint**.
> The generated layout is **part of the architecture contract**.
>
> Refactors that rename canonical package families, move code outside detected bounded contexts,
> or introduce unexpected top-level families may be detected as **architecture drift** and fail the build.

### What guardrails are (and are not)

Guardrails are:

* **Generated** (not handwritten)
* **Executable** (evaluated as tests)
* **Deterministic** (same input → same outcome)
* **Build-time only** (no runtime checks)

They are **not**:

* Documentation
* Conventions
* Runtime safety nets

Guardrails exist to make architectural boundaries **observable, enforceable, and non-bypassable**.

---

### How to run guardrails

Guardrails are evaluated during:

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

---

### Where the generated rules live

```text
src/test/java/io/github/blueprintplatform/greeting/architecture/archunit/
```

These tests are **generated code**. They represent the architecture contract selected at generation time.

---

### Guardrails categories

All guardrails fall into three categories:

1. **Dependency guardrails**

Control allowed and forbidden dependency directions between layers/components.

2. **Boundary guardrails**

Protect public boundaries (e.g., REST) from leaking internal or domain types.

3. **Schema & contract guardrails**

Protect the **meaning and scope** of guardrails by validating the package schema and bounded-context detection.

> Schema guardrails are critical: without them, dependency rules can be accidentally bypassed by refactoring package names.

---



### Guardrails status: enabled (`strict`)

**Strict** mode treats architecture as a **non-negotiable contract**.

Any structural drift, boundary leakage, or rename-based bypass will **fail the build deterministically**.

#### What strict guardrails enforce

Strict guardrails are generated **because this project was created with `--guardrails strict`**.

Strict mode enforces:

* **Full dependency direction contracts** (layout-specific)
  * Standard: strict layered direction rules between `controller/service/repository/domain/config`
* **Domain purity**
  * Domain may depend only on **JDK types** and **other domain types**
  * No framework / delivery / persistence dependencies
* **Boundary isolation** (Spring Web only)
  * REST controllers must not expose domain types in method signatures
  * Boundary DTOs must not depend on domain types
* **Schema & rename enforcement**
  * Within each detected bounded context, classes must reside under the **canonical families**
  * This prevents silent bypass via package renaming or “unknown family” drift
* **Family-local cycle prevention**
  * Cycles are forbidden **inside each canonical family** (and adapter sub-families where applicable)

---

#### Standard — Strict (Layered)

**Layer dependency enforcement**
  * `controller` must **not depend on**:
      * `repository`
      * `domain.service`
  * `service` must **not depend on** `controller`
  * `repository` must **not depend on** `service` or `controller`

**Domain purity**

* `domain` may depend only on:
  * JDK (`java.*`)
  * other domain types

**Schema & rename enforcement (contract integrity)**
  * Within each detected bounded context, classes must reside under the canonical families

* Within each detected bounded context, every class must reside under one of:
  * `controller`
  * `service`
  * `repository`
  * `domain`
  * `config`

**Cycle prevention (family-local)**

* No cyclic dependencies inside:
  * `controller`, `service`, `repository`, `domain`, `config`

**REST boundary isolation** (only when `spring-boot-starter-web` is present)

* `@RestController` under `controller..` must not expose domain types in:
  * return types
  * parameters
  * generic signatures
* Controller DTOs (`controller.dto..`) must not depend on domain

---

#### Operational note

Strict mode is intentionally fail-fast.
If you want adoption-first enforcement with fewer constraints, use **Basic** instead.

## 🧪 Included Sample (Basic)

Because `--sample-code basic` was selected, the project includes a minimal
end-to-end **Greeting** slice that demonstrates a classic
**standard (layered) architecture** in its simplest, most readable form.

This sample is intentionally small.
Its purpose is **not** to showcase advanced patterns,
but to provide a clear baseline for how layers collaborate
in a traditional Spring Boot application.

The sample is intentionally isolated under a dedicated package
to keep your own application code clean and to make removal straightforward.

```text
io.github.blueprintplatform.greeting.bp.sample
```

This keeps user-owned packages clean and makes the sample removable as a single subtree.

### What this sample demonstrates

* an inbound **REST controller**
* an **application/service layer** orchestrating a use case
* a **pure domain model** (no Spring, no IO)
* a simple **audit side effect** triggered after the use case
* mapping from domain objects to HTTP response DTOs

The flow is deliberately straightforward:

```text
HTTP → Controller → Service → Domain → Service → Controller → DTO
```

This makes the sample easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to evolve.

### Sample REST endpoints

Base path:

```text
/api/v1/sample/greetings
```

### Available endpoints

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings/default`

Returns a default greeting.

**GET** `/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John`

Returns a personalized greeting.

Example calls:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings/default | jq
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sample/greetings?name=John" | jq
```

### Where to look in the code

To understand the sample, start with these classes:

* **REST controller**
  * `bp/sample/controller/GreetingController`

---

* **Application / use-case service**
  * `bp/sample/service/GreetingService`

---

* **Pure domain logic**
  * `bp/sample/domain/service/GreetingDomainService`
  * `bp/sample/domain/model/Greeting`

---

* **Audit side effect**
  * `bp/sample/repository/GreetingAuditRepository`

Each layer has a single, focused responsibility and communicates only with the layer directly below it.

### How to use this sample

You can use this sample in two ways:

* as a **baseline reference** for a standard layered Spring Boot project
* as a **starting point** to gradually introduce more advanced concepts
(transactions, persistence, messaging, or even a future migration to hexagonal architecture)

This sample is intentionally conservative by design.
It favors clarity over abstraction, and explicit flow over indirection.

## Scope & Intent

This generated project intentionally focuses on **structural correctness and observable architectural guardrails**.

Delivery concerns (CI/CD, containerization, deployment strategies) are left to the consuming team and platform standards.
