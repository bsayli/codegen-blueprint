# Release Notes — Codegen Blueprint 1.0.0 GA

**Release date:** 2026-01-05
**Version:** `1.0.0` (starts the `1.0.x` line)

Codegen Blueprint **1.0.0 GA** is the point where this repository becomes a **product contract** — not an experiment.

This release is intentionally **narrow**, **deterministic**, and **architecture-first**.

> If something is **not explicitly guaranteed**, it is **not part of the 1.0.0 GA contract**.

---

## 🧭 How to read the documentation (authority order)

1. **Executable Architecture Contract (binding)** — what is guaranteed in GA.
2. **Executable Proof (demonstration)** — reproducible **GREEN → RED → GREEN** validation.
3. **Architecture Guardrails Rulebook (semantics)** — vocabulary & interpretation.
4. **Generated Output (contract surface)** — READMEs + ArchUnit tests are the materialized contract.

**Contracts bind. Proof demonstrates. Rulebooks explain. Generated output executes.**

## 🚀 Highlights

* **Executable proof included** — reproducible **GREEN → RED → GREEN** loop using **build-time guardrails only**.
* **Architecture guardrails (opt-in)** — generated **ArchUnit** tests fail the build **deterministically** on drift.
* **Two architecture models (opt-in)** — `hexagonal` (ports & adapters) and `standard` (layered).
* **Buildable-by-default output** — generated projects pass **`mvn verify`** immediately after generation.
* **GA contracts are explicit** — guarantees, release discipline, and non-goals are documented.

---

## ✅ GA guarantees (1.0.0)

* **Deterministic generation** — same input → same output.
* **Test-ready output** — generated projects pass **`mvn verify`** immediately.
* **Layout choice (opt-in)** — `hexagonal` or `standard`.
* **Guardrails (opt-in)** — generated ArchUnit tests evaluated at **build time** (`mvn verify`).
* **Clean core by construction** — generator keeps its **domain** framework-free (self-guarded by CI).

---

## 🧪 Recommended first run: executable proof

Run the proof to see **GREEN → RED → GREEN** without app startup:

```bash
cd docs/demo
chmod +x ./proof/proof-runner.sh
CODEGEN_JAR=../../target/codegen-blueprint-1.0.0.jar ./proof/proof-runner.sh
```

Expected:

1. initial green build
2. intentional violation → deterministic failure
3. corrected structure → green build

## 📌 GA stack profile

**Active GA profile:** `springboot-maven-java`

**Compatibility targets:**

* **Java:** 21
* **Spring Boot:** 3.4–3.5 (default: 3.5)
* **Maven:** 3.9+

---

## 📦 Output contract (generated project)

Generated projects are **single-module** and include:

* `pom.xml` (with Maven Wrapper)
    * `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`
    * `mvnw`
    * `mvnw.cmd`
* `src/main/java/<basePackage>/...`
* `src/test/java/<basePackage>/...`
* `src/main/resources/application.yml`
* `.gitignore`
* `README.md` (part of the generated contract surface)

> The generated README and the generated ArchUnit tests are part of the **delivered contract surface**.

---

## 🚫 Explicit non-goals (GA)

1.0.0 GA does **not** guarantee:

* runtime behavior or performance
* production correctness
* unlimited dependency freedom
* template stability as a public API

---

## 🧾 Release & compatibility discipline

Versions are **contracts**:

* **MAJOR** — contract reset
* **MINOR** — backward-compatible expansion
* **PATCH** — bug fixes only

Patch releases in `1.0.x` will **not**:

* change CLI contracts
* modify generated project structure
* alter guardrails semantics

Reference:

* [Release Discipline](https://github.com/blueprint-platform/codegen-blueprint/blob/main/docs/policies/release-discipline.md)

---

## 🧭 What’s next (non-binding direction)

Not part of the GA contract:

1. Strengthen contract & proof
2. Add new delivery surfaces (CLI → REST) without changing the core engine
3. Deliver cross-cutting behavior as capabilities via shared libraries + governance
4. Expand profiles cautiously (Gradle / Kotlin / Quarkus / UI)

## Thank you

Thanks for evaluating Codegen Blueprint as intended:

* clarity over velocity
* integrity over convenience
* **architecture as an executable product**

**Architecture as an executable product** — the 1.0.0 GA philosophy in one line.
